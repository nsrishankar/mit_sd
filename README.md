## MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars

1. DeepTraffic:

(DRL) The goal is to create a neural network to drive a vehicle (or multiple vehicles) as fast as possible through dense highway traffic. An instance of your neural network gets to control one of the cars (displayed in red) and has to learn how to navigate efficiently to go as fast as possible. **_Disclaimer:_** _Definitely uncomfortable for passengers._
